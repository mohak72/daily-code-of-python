### Daily Workflow

**Morning: Start Your Day**
```bash
# 1. Start new day (creates branch, updates tracking)

# üìÅ Project directory: /number-guessing-game
```

**During the Day: Code Your Project**
- Build your project in the designated directory
- Commit your changes as you go (optional)
- Test your code

**Evening: Complete Your Day**
```bash
# 2. Complete the day (commits all changes, marks complete)
python 100days.py complete

# Output:
# üéâ Completing Day 5: Number guessing game
# ‚úÖ Day 5 completed!
# üîÄ Ready to create PR from branch: day-05-number-guessing-game
```

**Create Pull Request**
```bash
# Option A: Using GitHub CLI
gh pr create --fill

# Option B: Manually on GitHub
# Push your branch and create PR through GitHub UI

# Option C: Use GitHub Actions workflow

## Branch Naming Convention

Branches are automatically created with this format:
```
day-{number}-{project-name}
```

Examples:
- `day-05-number-guessing-game`
- `day-12-tic-tac-toe-game`
- `day-21-portfolio-website-with-flask-django`

---

## Tracking File Updates

The automation automatically updates `100days_of_python.md`:

**Progress Section:**
```markdown
## Progress Tracking
- [x] Projects Completed: 5/100
- [x] Current Project: Number guessing game
- [x] Days Completed: 5/100
```

**Project Checkboxes:**
```markdown
5. [x] Number guessing game
   - Status: Completed
   ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Branch already exists

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -D day-05-number-guessing-game

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete day-05-number-guessing-game

# Then try again
python 100days.py start 5
```

### Issue: Script can't find tracking file

**Solution:**
Make sure you're running commands from the repository root directory where `100days_of_python.md` exists.

### Issue: GitHub Actions fails with permission error

**Solution:**
1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Click **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
3. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select **Read and write permissions**
   - Check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
4. Click **Save**

### Issue: Git push fails (authentication)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Configure GitHub credentials
gh auth login

# Or use SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
# Add the key to GitHub: Settings ‚Üí SSH Keys
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Commit Early and Often** - Don't wait until the end of the day
2. **Write Good Commit Messages** - Describe what you built
3. **Test Before Completing** - Run your code to make sure it works
4. **Document Your Learnings** - Add notes to your PR descriptions
5. **Review Your PRs** - Look over your code before merging
6. **Merge Regularly** - Don't let PRs pile up

---

## Advanced Usage

### Skip to a Specific Project

```bash
# Start day 10 specifically
python 100days.py start 10
```

### Manual Branch Management

```bash
# If you want to manage branches manually
git checkout -b day-05-custom-name

# Use the helper just for tracking
python .github/scripts/100days_helper.py complete-day 5
```

### Customize PR Templates

Edit `.github/workflows/100days-automation.yml` around line 50 to customize the PR body template.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to create PRs for every project?**
A: No, but it's recommended for tracking progress and building your GitHub portfolio.

**Q: Can I work on multiple days at once?**
A: The automation expects one day at a time, but you can manually create multiple branches.

**Q: What if I want to skip a project?**
A: Manually mark it complete in `100days_of_python.md` by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.

**Q: Can I use this for other challenge formats?**
A: Yes! Edit `100days_of_python.md` to match your challenge format.
