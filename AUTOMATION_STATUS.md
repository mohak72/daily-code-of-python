```bash
git fetch
git branch -r | grep day-07
```

## Troubleshooting (If Automation Fails)

### If workflow doesn't start:
- Check GitHub Actions tab for errors
- Verify schedule syntax in workflow file
- Ensure repository settings allow Actions

### If tests fail:
- An issue will be auto-created
- Review the code in the branch
- Fix manually and run `python 100days.py complete`

### If no PR created:
- Check if tests passed
- Verify GH_TOKEN permissions
- Can create PR manually: `gh pr create`

## Next Steps After Day 7

Once Day 7 PR is created:
1. Review the generated code
2. Test the application manually
3. Approve and merge the PR
4. Repeat daily for Days 8-100

The automation will continue running daily, creating one project per day automatically!
